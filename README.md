# Shortest Path In Grid With Obstacles And Variable Speed

# Problem description
  - Given a grid of squares, find the shortest path (least number of hops) from one square to another. 
  - The hopper has speed [0,0] initially and can change his speed in both directions by -1, 0, 1 per hop, keeping the new speed after the hop.
  - Obstacles are given so that the hopper can not land on those squares

# Input

1: Number of test cases

2: Width height

3: Starting point, ending point

4: Number of obstacles (P)

P lines: x1, x2, y1, y2 (obstacle area)
